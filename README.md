# Power-BI-Based-Risk-Analysis-for-Banking-and-Financial-Services
This project focuses on developing a risk analytics system for the banking and financial services sector to assist in making data-driven decisions while lending to customers. Using Power BI, we created interactive dashboards that analyze an applicantâ€™s profile to assess the likelihood of loan repayment, thereby minimizing the risk of defaults.
